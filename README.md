Hi, I'm Marc Martínez


Experienced mobile app developer in both Android (Java) and iOS (Xamarin) environments. Skilled with working as a team and incorporating input into projects. Ability to always look for ways to improve upon an already existing app to keep people downloading it and enjoying it. Strong eye for detail and tenacity to never quit on something until it is absolutely perfect.
I have also worked for many years in web environments with .NET technologies.

Currently, apart from maintaining the apps on Android and iOS, I also contribute to the maintenance of the API and the backend with .NET (C#).
